‚Ä¢ Food preferences:
  - Enjoy meals inspired by the following cuisines: Mexican, Italian, vegetarian, and classic pub-style fare. But also open to other ideas
  - Meals must be toddler-friendly (low spice, no strong heat).
  - Comfort food welcome; health-conscious but flexible.
  - Include 1 vegetarian meal every other week.
‚Ä¢ Food restrictions:
  - No seafood or fish meat but fish derived products are ok.
  - Dairy is acceptable **except cow‚Äôs milk**. Goat and sheep milk products are fine (e.g., goat cheese, sheep yogurt).
  - No deep-fried meals.
‚Ä¢ Cook + prep time per meal: 45 minutes maximum.

=== KITCHEN EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE ===
‚Ä¢ Air fryer (must be used in at least 2 meals per week).
‚Ä¢ Microwave
‚Ä¢ Conventional oven
‚Ä¢ Kettle
‚Ä¢ Blender
‚Ä¢ Slow cooker (must be eaten on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday‚Äîlabel accordingly)

=== INGREDIENT GUIDELINES ===
‚Ä¢ Use ingredients commonly available in Australian supermarkets (e.g., Coles, Woolworths).
‚Ä¢ Avoid overly exotic ingredients or hard-to-find products.
‚Ä¢ Reuse ingredients across meals where practical to minimize waste.
